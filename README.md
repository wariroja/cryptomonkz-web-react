### Running the project locally
`npm install` to install all of the dependencies
`npm start` to start the project

## Roadmap

MVP: 
- [x] Refactor HTML, CSS and JavaScript to React components, following project's section structure 
- [x] Refactor jquery logic: break common.js file into smaller chunks and add it to relevant component utlizing jquery modules

Future improvements:
- [ ] Fix liMarquee plugin bugs or change to a new lib (it's no longer maintained)
- [ ] Fix swiper plugin bugs or change to a new lib (versioning error/unreliable)
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Refactor jquery logic into two separate logics (ui and data)
- [ ] Remove unused functions and variables

Challenges: 
- Spent quite sometime on liMarquee and swiper plug in bug not working as expected (affecting image carousel section and team section)
